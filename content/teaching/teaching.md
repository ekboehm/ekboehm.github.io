At Princeton, I have taught Graduate Econometrics (ECO 517), as well as Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECO 313) and Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECO 101), for which I also acted as course organizer. 

I was also the instructor for the School of Policy and International Affairs MPA Math Camp (MPA 635C).

During my time at Mannheim I also taught Introduction to Macroeconomics, as well as Linear Algebra for Math and Computer Science students.
