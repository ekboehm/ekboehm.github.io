Welcome to my website! My name is Eduard Boehm, I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Economics at Princeton University. I work in the intersection of Industrial Organization and Public Economics. My research focuses on the role that information plays in the decisions that made by consumers, firms and the government -- and its implications for the design of public policies.

In my main project, I study the interaction the role of intermediation in addressing cognitive frictions -- potentially making mistakes in decisions -- and how this affects market outcomes in a selection market. 

I am also interested in higher education admissions and the implications of the use of different selection tools -- such as GPA and standardized test scores -- for the diversity and academic achievements of students. Finally, I am also interested in tax policy and the desing of efficient and well-targeted fiscal policy.

I hold a B.Sc. in Economics (with a minor in Math) from the University of Mannheim and an M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics.  Outside work, I enjoy playing volleyball and the electric guitar, and recently also embarrassing myself trying to dance tango.
