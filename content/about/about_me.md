I am an Assistant Professor in the Deparment of Economics at the London School of Economics.

I use methods from Empirical Industrial Organization to study questions related to Public Finance. My research focuses on the role that information plays in the decisions made by consumers, firms and the government – and its implications for the design of public policies.

<!-- I study in the impact of intermediation in insurance markets where consumers face choice frictions. 

I am also interested in higher education admissions and the implications of the use of different selection tools -- such as GPA and standardized test scores – for the diversity and academic achievements of students. Finally, I am also interested in tax policy and the design of efficient and well-targeted fiscal policy. -->

I got my Ph.D. from Princeton University, where I was advised by Kate Ho and Alessandro Lizzeri. I also hold a B.Sc. in Economics (with a minor in Math) from the University of Mannheim and an M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics. I'm originally from Chile!

<!-- I'm from Chile. Outside work, I enjoy playing volleyball, the electric guitar, and trying to dance tango. -->
