I am a sixth year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Princeton University, advised by Kate Ho and Alessandro Lizzeri.

I use methods from Empirical Industrial Organization to study questions related to Public Finance. My research focuses on the role that information plays in the decisions made by consumers, firms and the government – and its implications for the design of public policies.

In my job market paper, I explore the impact of intermediation in insurance markets where consumers face choice frictions. 

I am also interested in higher education admissions and the implications of the use of different selection tools -- such as GPA and standardized test scores – for the diversity and academic achievements of students. Finally, I am also interested in tax policy and the design of efficient and well-targeted fiscal policy.

I hold a B.Sc. in Economics (with a minor in Math) from the University of Mannheim and an M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics.
