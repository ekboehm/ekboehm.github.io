### Intermediation, Cognitive Frictions and Adverse Selection: Evidence from the Chilean Pension Market
This paper analyzes consumer choices under cognitive frictions and the role of intermediaries in a selection market. Individuals face costs of understanding the value of complex products even when all information is readily available, which can lead to sub-optimal choices. They can choose to hire an intermediary to provide them with information, but these induce distortions due to their commission being linked to the product purchased. I show evidence on the importance of accounting for these information frictions and their interaction with intermediaries in the Chilean retirement and annuity market. Intermediary choices strongly predict product choices. Intermediation also plays a role in mitigating adverse selection into annuities. I propose a model of cognitive frictions, complex product choice, and selection into intermediation. The model intuitively captures the roles of the cost of acquiring information, prior beliefs and intermediaries’ distortions. I estimate this model on Chilean data and use it to quantify the importance of information frictions and distortions induced by intermediaries. I then explore the impacts of information interventions and intermediary regulation on market-level selection, choices and prices.
