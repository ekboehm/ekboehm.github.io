<p>This paper analyzes consumer choices under cognitive frictions and the role of intermediaries in a selection market. Individuals face costs of understanding the value of complex products even when all information is readily available, which can lead to sub-optimal choices. They can choose to hire an inter- mediary to provide them with information, but these induce distortions due to their commission being linked to the product purchased. I show evidence on the importance of accounting for these information frictions and their interaction with intermediaries in the Chilean retirement and annuity market. Inter- mediary choices strongly predict product choices. Intermediation also plays a role in mitigating adverse selection into annuities. I propose a model of cognitive frictions, complex product choice, and selection into intermediation. The model intuitively captures the roles of the cost of acquiring information, prior beliefs and intermediaries’ distortions. I estimate this model on Chilean data and use it to quantify the importance of information frictions and distortions induced by intermediaries. I then explore the impacts of information interventions and intermediary regulation on market-level selection, choices and prices.</p>
