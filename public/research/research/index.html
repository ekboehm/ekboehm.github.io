<p>This paper analyzes the welfare effects of intermediaries in a longevity insurance market with selection. Intermediaries help retirees overcome choice frictions and improve choices, but they can also lead to distortions if their financial incentives are not aligned with their customers&rsquo;. In an insurance market, these competing effects can lead to changes in consumers&rsquo; selection into products, which in turn impact average costs and prices. I document the importance of intermediation and its connection to adverse selection in the context of Chilean pension market, where products are complex and intermediaries have an incentive to sell annuities. I propose a model of complex product choice and selection into intermediation and use it to recover preferences and quantify the size of choice frictions and distortions induced by intermediaries. Under conservative assumptions on individual beliefs, a ban on intermediation is welfare neutral. Annuitization falls from 60% to 40% and adverse selection increases annuity costs from 2 to 6%. Distortions from intermediaries are of the order of 10% of pension payments, which are matched by the sum of friction costs, mistakes in choices and price increases due to selection. The variety of annuities and their substitutability with the outside option explain the results. My results highlight the value provided by intermediaries, the aggregate and distributional implications of cognitive frictions and the trade-offs between individual and market-wide outcomes faced by regulators and policy makers.</p>
