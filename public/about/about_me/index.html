    </header><p>Welcome to my website! My name is Eduard Boehm, I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Economics at Princeton University. I work in the intersection of Industrial Organization and Public Economics. My research focuses on the role that information plays in the decisions that made by consumers, firms and the government &ndash; and its implications for the design of public policies.</p>
<p>In my main project, I study the interaction the role of intermediation in addressing cognitive frictions &ndash; potentially making mistakes in decisions &ndash; and how this affects market outcomes in a selection market.</p>
<p>I am also interested in higher education admissions and the implications of the use of different selection tools &ndash; such as GPA and standardized test scores &ndash; for the diversity and academic achievements of students. Finally, I am also interested in tax policy and the desing of efficient and well-targeted fiscal policy.</p>
<p>I hold a B.Sc. in Economics (with a minor in Math) from the University of Mannheim and an M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics.  Outside work, I enjoy playing volleyball and the electric guitar, and recently also embarrassing myself trying to dance tango.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reach out anytime to chat! &ndash; you can reach me at eboehm at princeton dot edu</p>
